// label was decided by two lines:
//
//   let o="Sign In with Cursor",c="primary";
//   r ? (o="Sign Out",c="secondary") : i && (o="Cancel",c="tertiary")
//
// `r` is `l.kind==="logged-in"` and nothing in this build ever puts the status there: the
// account-chip patch deliberately leaves `isSignedIn:!1` alone, because faking a signed-in
// state is forbidden, so `r` is false on every render. The button could therefore only ever say
// "Sign In with Cursor" or "Cancel", and it offered the one account the router refuses to hand
// this build — `no-cursor-provider` has no entry for it. Clicking it called `t.login()`, a real
// browser OAuth flow for a session nothing here can spend a token against.
//
// The first anchor deletes both not-signed-in labels instead of rewording one of them: a deleted
// branch cannot grow new copy, a reworded one can. `o` and `c` are left holding the sign-out
// pair, which is the only state the second anchor is able to render, so the string left in the
// chunk is one the renderer already ships on a branch it can actually reach. No new sentence is
// written here.
//
// The second anchor gates the element on `r` and moves `r` into slot 40 of the memo's dependency
// test. That half is load-bearing, not a tidy-up, and the reason is in React rather than in this
// chunk: `useMemoCache` (react-dom-client.development.js, `function useMemoCache(size)`) copies
// the previous render's cache forward on an update and returns the SAME array, so those slots
// still hold the last render's values and the dependency test alone decides whether a cached
// value is reused or recomputed. `o` is a constant after the first anchor, so a test that still
// read `o` could never change: the first signed-out render would cache `null`, every later render
// would hand that `null` straight back, and "Sign Out" would be missing from the one screen that
// needs it until the card unmounted. Slot 40 carries `r`, the value the memo's result now depends
// on, which is what the compiler emits for every other piece of state in this component.
//
// The element itself is untouched, so if a signed-in account ever becomes reachable the same
// button, the same `variant` and the same `logout()` handler still run.
//
// The card is not deleted, because it is not only a sign-in affordance: it carries the avatar,

// beside `profile.json` and is read on every prompt build. Nothing was missing on
// the server. What was missing was a box.
//
// The agent dialog is `h3n`, in the registry chunk, and it is the one surface that
// already edits the other two things an agent IS: `h3n` renders "Name", "Title"
// and "Description" through the same `Uwe` field and commits each through a handler
// that the dialog's caller wires to `updateAgent`. Instructions were the fourth
// field, and the omission was invisible — the agent worked by the brief the user
// typed, the prompt said so, and the settings screen showed three short boxes and
// no sign that a fourth existed.
//
// The shape of the fix is the shape of the three fields above, deliberately: the
// same `Uwe` multiline field, the same label element and label classes, the same
// `updateAgent` call carrying `name`/`description` unchanged so a save cannot drop
