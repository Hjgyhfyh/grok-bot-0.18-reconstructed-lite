 * platform failed with `ENOENT`, and the agent had no command line: it could not
 * read a file, list a directory, or run anything. The two symptoms it reported
 * were `Error: Command failed to spawn: Service temporarily unavailable. This may
 * be temporary; try again.` and `Error: Command failed to spawn: Aborted`, which
 * said nothing about a missing interpreter because nothing in this file named one.
 *
 * WHY `ComSpec` AND NOT POWERSHELL. Windows itself publishes `%ComSpec%` as the
 * path of the command interpreter, so it is the one value that is defined on a
 * stock Windows install and stays correct when the user changes their terminal.
 * `powershell.exe` may be absent entirely, and `getPowerShellExecutable` in
 * `packages/shell-exec/platform-shell.ts` throws when it is; a daemon that
 * cannot name its own interpreter would fail before it could report why.
 * PowerShell is also the slower of the two by an order of magnitude, and every
 * command the agent runs pays that. `packages/shell-exec/shell-env.ts` already
 * made this same choice for the host-side shell executor, and the two surfaces
 * must not disagree about what a command line is.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT TOUCHED. The POSIX branch is byte-for-byte the old one: `/bin/sh`,
 * `-lc`, resolved by the box itself. `detached` and `kill` below already branch
 * on the platform, and the box this daemon was written for is Linux, so its
 * behaviour and its existing tests must not change.

/**
 * Local stdio MCP servers on this box.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED. `loadMcpServers` was `async () => new LoadMcpServersResponse()`.
 * It discarded the configuration the host pushed and answered with an empty
 * `loadedServerNames`, so the host recorded a successful push of a stdio config
 * and then discovered nothing on the box. `BoxExecRuntime.execute` had no arm for
 * `mcpArgs`, `mcpStateExecArgs`, `listMcpResourcesExecArgs` or
 * `readMcpResourceExecArgs`, so every MCP request left through `default:` as
 * `Unsupported ExecServerMessage case`, which the host turns into HTTP 500. A live
 * probe of the running box answered `listBoxMcpServers` with
 * `{"error":"Unsupported ExecServerMessage case: mcpStateExecArgs"}`.
 *
 * WHERE THE PROCESS RUNS, AND WHAT THAT COSTS. A stdio server is a child process.
 * It does not go through `resolvePath`, `assertRealPathAllowed` or
 * `PathRejectedError` — those constrain `Shell` and `Read`, and a process the
 * daemon starts on purpose is not a path operation. That is the whole honest
 * statement of this feature's security posture, and it rests on one property: the
 * model cannot write the configuration. The JSON arrives from
 * `tools-discovery.ts` (`{ mcpServers: {...} }`) built from
 * `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GrokBotLocalBox\mcp-servers.json`, which only the user edits by
 * hand. If the model could write that file it could hand itself
 * `{"command":"cmd","args":["/c", …]}` and no check in this file would help,
 * because the check has to run before the process exists.
 *
 * WHAT IS CHECKED HERE. Every absolute path in `command`/`args` — and every token
 * carrying a `..` segment, which used to skip the check entirely — is resolved and
 * run past `assertRealPathAllowed`, so a script outside the workspace roots is
 * refused and reported as a per-server `error` instead of being started.
 *
 * WHAT WAS STILL MISSING, AND IS NOT. `{"command":"cmd"}` resolved through PATH,
 * is not a path, and was started. The whole defence rested on the model being
 * unable to write the configuration, which is one property, checked in another
 * process, and true only for as long as that writer path stays shut.
 * `checkMcpLaunchAllowed` now also requires that a program named by PATH has its
 * script named by path, and refuses a command processor by name. It deliberately
 * does NOT refuse bare names as such: the user's own file runs servers as
 * `{"command":"node","args":["<box-workspace>\\mcp-servers\\…"]}`, and breaking
 * that would trade a real hole for a fake one. The rest of what is still open is
 * written down at `checkMcpLaunchAllowed` rather than left implied.
 *
 * SECRETS. `env` values are the supported way to hand a server a token and they
 * travel as plaintext JSON from the host. No value from `env` is logged, returned,
 * or allowed to reach an error string: every message built from a child's output is
 * passed through {@link redactSecrets} first, because a server that prints its own
 * environment into stderr would otherwise publish the token through
 * `McpStateServer.errorMessage`.

  /**
   * Decides whether one configured stdio entry may be started, and says why not.
   *
   * Two rules, in this order.
   *
   * 1. `command` MAY NOT BE A COMMAND PROCESSOR. `{"command":"cmd"}` was the hole:
   *    it is not a path, it resolved through PATH, and it started. This runs first
   *    because it is the only rule that can explain the entry: `cmd /c …` also
   *    trips rule 2 on its `/c`, and a user told their script escapes the roots
   *    would go looking in the wrong place.
   *
   * 2. EVERY PATH-LIKE TOKEN IS CONTAINED, AND A PROGRAM NAMED BY PATH MUST HAVE
   *    ITS SCRIPT NAMED BY PATH. The containment half is unchanged: each absolute
   *    path, and each token carrying a `..` segment, is resolved and run past
   *    `assertRealPathAllowed`. The second half is new, and it is deliberately NOT
   *    "refuse every bare name". The shipped product runs servers exactly that way —
   *    `{"command":"node","args":["<box-workspace>\\mcp-servers\\dsh-agent-mcp-server.mjs"]}`
   *    is the shape the user's own file has, and refusing it would break working
   *    configuration to punish a name that was never the defect.
   *
   *    So the daemon insists on the part that can actually be checked: when the
   *    program is a PATH name, its script must be an explicit path, and the
   *    containment half has already proved that path is inside the roots. One
   *    requirement closes every interpreter escape, because an inline program is
   *    never a path: `node -e …`, `python -c …`, and `cmd /c …`. A program given by
   *    absolute path is left exactly as it was.
   *
   * WHAT IS STILL NOT SOLVED, STATED PLAINLY. The operating system, not the
   * daemon, decides which file a bare name means, and a program outside
   * {@link COMMAND_PROCESSOR_NAMES} that is itself an escape hatch is not caught
   * by the shape rule. Closing that needs an explicit allowlist of launchable
   * programs — a capability decision about the sandbox model, not a daemon edit.
   *
   * Every message returned here quotes tokens out of the user's file, so it is
   * passed through {@link redactSecrets} with the entry's own `env` values before
   * it leaves this method. `env` is never printed here.
