     * The question an agent is blocked on, for a caller that never saw the card.
     *
     * `resolveLocalToolPermission` above is the only half of the round trip that
     * existed. The other half — `getPendingRequestForAgent` on the controller —
     * had no caller in the repository outside a test, and no gateway command read
     * it. The card is a push: `bindLocalPermissionSurface` in
     * `host-runner-composition.ts` subscribes to the controller and emits the ask
     * as a `local-tool-permission` transcript entry, so the question exists for the
     * user only from the moment the renderer happens to be listening for that one
     * agent. A window closed before that emit, or an agent whose conversation is
     * not the open one, leaves the tool call blocked inside `authorize` behind a
     * referenced ten-minute timer that holds the event loop open. Nothing on
     * screen says a question is waiting, and when the ask expires on its own the
     * agent is told the user never answered — which is true and is not what
     * happened.
     *
     * The answer is a LIST, not a single object and not a `404`. At most one ask
     * per agent is open at a time in practice, but the shape has to survive an
     * agent that opens a second one while this caller was mid-poll, and an empty
     * list has to read as "nobody is waiting on you" — the normal state of every
     * agent, polled on a timer — rather than as a missing endpoint. `requirePath`
     * names `agentId` in the refusal for the same reason the neighbours above do:
     * a caller holding `{}` is told which field to fix instead of being handed a
     * V8 sentence about a `Map`.
     *
     * It is a pull. It answers whoever asks, at the moment they ask. It does not
     * make the user look at the question; see `tests/list-pending-local-tool-permissions.test.mjs`
     * for what is still missing on the interface side of this.
