 * `%USERPROFILE%` itself. Escaping the root was already refused — `containPath`
 * below has done that honestly since the containment existed — but the root
 * itself was the user's whole account, so the containment closed nothing: inside
 * the root the agent could read `AppData\Local\GrokBotLocalBox\gateway.json`,
 * which carries the loopback gateway bearer token, `launcher-secrets.txt`,
 * `launcher-gateway-token.txt`, `.ssh`, and every other file the account owns.
 * A file the agent can read is a file it can put in a transcript.
 *
 * The fallback is now the box workspace, which is the directory the agent is
 * actually meant to work in and the directory the box exec daemon is given as
 * its workspace root. Everything outside it is refused by the same check that
 * already existed; only the default moved.
 *
 * An explicit `SAND_LOCAL_EXEC_ROOT` or `SAND_AGENT_PROJECT_DIR` still wins, so
 * an operator who wants a different root is not overruled by this.
