/**
 * The agent used to tell the user it could do nothing but generate text, and it was telling the
 * truth about the request it had actually received.
 *
 * Two separate defects produced that answer, and only one of them was upstream of every prompt in
 * the repository.
 *
 * The first was interception. For any provider except `cursor`,
 * `createCoordinatorInferenceRouter` claimed `sendPrompt` for itself, flattened the transcript
 * into bare role/content messages, and called `runRoutedProviderText` with the routed MCP tool
 * list as its only tool source. With no connectors connected that list is empty, `toToolSet` turns
 * an empty array into `undefined`, and the request goes out with no `tools` key at all and
 * `GROK_ROUTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` -- four lines that describe no capability -- as the only system
 * text. A raw chat completion, reached through the Grok Bot UI, is exactly a bot with no hands.
 * That route now declines the turn: it runs no model completion over the conversation, offers no
 * tool list, and asks for one thing only, a conversation title. The turn itself is the agent on
 * the box, with its own prompt and its own toolset.
 *
 * The second was dishonesty in the prompt itself. A request captured off
 * `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1` carried 28 tools and a 74853-character system prompt, and that
 * prompt named nine tools the request did not carry -- CopyToBox, CopyFromBox, GetMcpTools,
 * CallMcpTool, Screenshot, GenerateImage, CheckSubagent, MessageSubagent and StopSubagent. Asked
 * in Russian what it could do, the model then listed them as its own tools, which is the symptom
 * that was reported. The prompt is now conditioned on the turn's own toolset: a fully wired agent
 * is told about every tool it carries, and a turn with no toolset to consult is told about no
 * optional family rather than about all of them.
 *
 * Nothing noticed because every half of the product was individually healthy: the agent runner
 * sent a correct prompt with a correct toolset, and the routed provider was a working text
 * completion. Only the composition was broken. These tests prove both halves, so a future trim
 * to the agent prompt cannot be mistaken for this bug again, and so the routed path cannot
 * silently lose its last remaining capability text.
