 * `createRuntime`. On a machine with no account the coordinator process therefore did
 * not exist at all: `production-provider.requestRendererPort` had no active session to
 * hand the renderer its MessagePort, and every one of the ~140
 * `COORDINATOR_METHOD_TABLE` methods was unreachable — including `listAgents`,
 * `createAgent`, `sendPrompt` and `getOnboardingSeen`, the renderer's very first call,
 * so the window could not even render its own startup screen. Nothing reported a
 * failure, because every earlier test of this module started from an already signed-in
 * status, which always produced a slot.
