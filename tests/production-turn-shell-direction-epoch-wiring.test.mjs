/**
 * The direction epoch was fixed in the turn shell and never reached the app.
 *
 * `SAND_LOCAL_TOOLS_ABANDONED_MESSAGE` tells the model that a request the user already declined
 * "will not run and will not be asked again for this task", and the only thing in the tree that
 * can end that task is the direction epoch: `refusalFor` compares the epoch a refusal was
 * remembered under against the epoch the request is made in. Four files made that number move —
 * `production-turn-run-shell-adapter.ts` resolves it once per turn and writes it into the turn
 * context, `sand-agent-runner.ts` opens one direction per turn and reads the number back, and the
 * toolset reads it out of the context on every scoped call. All four were correct and all four were
 * unreachable, because the object that finally assembles a production turn shell never handed them
 * a controller: `createProductionTurnRunShellHostInput` in `host-runner-composition.ts` was called
 * without `localToolPermission`, so `SandAgentRunner` read `undefined` at
 * `sand-agent-runner.ts:377`, left the shell's `beginLocalToolPermissionTurn` hook unbound, and
 * `resolveTurnDirectionEpoch` returned `undefined` on every turn of the life of the process. There
 * was no throw, no log and no red state — only a controller nobody had told about, and a number
 * that stayed 0.
 *
 * The obvious repair passes the wrong object. The file already had a projection of the same
 * controller for the toolset host, `asLocalToolPermissionProjection`, and it keeps exactly
 * `{awaitDesktopStandingDecision, completeScope}` — both methods a turn needs are dropped, so the
 * field looks present, the type still narrows, and the epoch silently stays 0 again. These tests
 * are built to catch that: the shell's controller must answer with the LIVE controller's own
 * numbers, which a projection cannot do because it has no `directionEpoch` to call.
 *
 * These tests drive the production composition itself — `createHostRunnerComposition` →
 * `createRunner` → `buildProductionTurnRunShellInput` → `createProductionTurnRunShellHostInput` →
 * `runnerOptions.productionTurnRunShell` → `new SandAgentRunner(options)` — with the real
 * `SandLocalToolPermissionController` behind it and only the model Agent replaced by a seam. Both
 * production call sites are measured: the parent's own shell (the assignment near the end of
 * `createRunner`) and the shell of a `Task` subagent, which the composition builds inside a turn
 * from its own scope. The falsifications at the bottom answer `host-runner-composition.ts` from
 * `git show HEAD:…` and from two single-line source mutations — the tree is never written to — and
 * each one shows the same probe against exactly the code that breaks it.
