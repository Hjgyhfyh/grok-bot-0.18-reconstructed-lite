/**
 * An agent could not change its own name, title or description. The tool the
 * product advertises for exactly that \u2014 `update_state`, `target: "profile"` \u2014
 * was wired to a profile writer that no caller ever supplied:
 * `createSandAgentState` called `deps.readProfile()`, and the only production
 * call site of `createAgentState` (`host-runner-composition.ts`, the
 * `agentStateOwner` build) passes memory, automations, workflows, channels,
 * agentDir, agentId and readBoxFile \u2014 no reader and no writer. A repo-wide
 * search found the two names nowhere but their own declaration. So every
 * `update_state` profile write ended on `TypeError: deps.readProfile is not a
 * function`, and the person using the app was right that it fails with an
 * error.
 *
 * Nothing noticed, for three reasons that are worth naming because they repeat.
 * One: the composer reaches the memory extension through `method()`, typed
 * `(...args: any[]) => any`, so a missing member of the dependency object is a
 * runtime `TypeError` and not a compile error. Two: the shape that fails is a
 * call, not a list \u2014 there is no fallback here to look healthy. Three: the same
 * owner answered `{ ok, message }` where `SandStateWriter` declares
 * `{ ok, detail }` / `{ ok, reason }`, so even a success would have reached the
 * model as `undefined` and a refusal as the sentence "Not saved \u2014 undefined".
 * The tool could not have reported the rename even if it had made one.
 *
 * What these tests close:
 *
 *  - the three fields are written, on a real agents root, through the real
 *    `AgentLifecycle.updateAgent` \u2014 the same host method the profile edit
 *    screen calls, with the agent's own id \u2014 and the model is told what
 *    changed in a sentence;
 *  - `title` is reachable at all, which before this change it was not: it is
 *    not in the tool's parameter schema and it was not in the writer;
 *  - a field the call leaves out keeps its stored value, which is the same
 *    silent-drop defect that made the flat `{"id","title"}` shape return the
 *    old value;
 *  - a call with nothing to change, a blank name, a host that answers with
 *    nothing, and a host that throws all answer with a sentence and leave the
 *    stored profile exactly as it was;
 *  - an owner built without a writer answers with a sentence instead of
 *    throwing, so the class of defect cannot come back silently;
 *  - the static guard proves the production call site actually binds
 *    `updateOwnProfile` to `updateAgent` on `session.id`, and counts what it
 *    found rather than trusting that it ran.
 *
 * What these tests do NOT prove: that a model will decide to call the tool.
 * They prove the host side \u2014 the write, the merge, the answer. The capability
 * limits below are asserted as refusals of the schema, not as prompt text, so
 * they hold no matter what the prompt says.
