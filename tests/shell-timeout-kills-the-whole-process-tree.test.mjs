// A shell that was cancelled left its descendants running on the user's machine.
//
// Every command the agent runs goes through `cmd.exe /c <command>`, so `python`
// is not a child of the agent — it is a *grandchild*, one level below the
// process `shell-exec` holds a handle on. Cancelling asked `child.kill()`, which
// on Windows is a `TerminateProcess` on one pid. `cmd.exe` died; the `python` it
// had started did not. Ten minutes of an agent retrying a command that kept
// timing out left seven of them behind, each still writing files and holding
// memory, and nothing anywhere named them.
//
// Nothing threw and nothing looked wrong. The tool result said the command was
// aborted, the exit code was reported, and every test in the suite was green —
// the leak is a process the test process no longer has a handle on, so no
// assertion in this repository could ever have seen it. `process.kill(-pid)`,
// which is the POSIX answer to exactly this, was already in the tree in
// `shell-exec/core.ts:38`, and on Windows it fails with `ESRCH` and kills
// nothing, so the branch that looked like it was handling this was dead on the
// platform the bug was measured on.
//
// There is a second, quieter part. Starting `taskkill /T /F` alongside the
// direct kill does not work either, and that is why this fix moves the direct
// kill rather than adding to it: `taskkill /T` learns the tree by walking down
// from a process that is *still alive*, and the direct kill removes the parent
// in microseconds. Measured, with a real `cmd.exe` and a real long-lived
// grandchild: async `taskkill` started first still left the grandchild running.
// Only the synchronous call, issued before the direct kill, killed it.
//
// These tests spawn a real `cmd.exe` and a real grandchild, cancel the real
// chain, and then ask the operating system whether the grandchild is still
// there. The last test builds `shell-core` out of `git HEAD` through an
// esbuild `onLoad` hook and runs the same scenario against it, so the defect is
// demonstrated against the old code rather than asserted from memory.
